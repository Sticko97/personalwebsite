    <p>HTML basics So what is HTML? HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup 
        language that defines the structure of your content.</p>

        <p> HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
        wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain
        way, or act a certain way.</p>
